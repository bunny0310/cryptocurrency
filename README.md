# cryptocurrency
Developed my own mock cryptocurrency using nodeJS and jest, and following a test-driven approach. Got a working knowledge of how blockchain and cryptocurrency works,
and studied different concepts such as hashing, nonce value, difficulty, transactions, wallets, etc. Deployed to Heroku.
